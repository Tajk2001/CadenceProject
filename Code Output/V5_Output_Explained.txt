# --- Model Interpretations Summary ---

# Logistic Regression (Shift vs No Shift):
# - Shifts are more likely at higher cadence, heart rate, and elevation.
# - Less likely when power is high or gear ratio is high (i.e., in harder gears).
# - Gradient is marginally significant; shifts may precede terrain changes.

# Multinomial Logistic Regression (Shift Type):
# - Harder shifts occur at higher cadence and lower speed.
# - Easier shifts are more likely when cadence drops (Cadence_Δ_1s negative).
# - Gear Ratio is a strong predictor: shifting harder often happens from easier gears.
# - 30s terrain changes (Gradient_Δ_30s, Effective_Gradient_Δ_30s) are significant.

# Linear Regression (Shift Magnitude):
# - Larger shifts occur with high cadence and large gear ratios.
# - Shift magnitude decreases with speed, increases with short-term terrain change.
# - Terrain and effort dynamics (e.g., Power_Δ_10s, Gradient_Δ_3s) influence shift size.

# Overall:
# - Strong evidence supports that riders shift to regulate cadence.
# - Terrain anticipation (especially over 30s) influences both type and magnitude of shifts.
# - Speed, cadence, and gear state collectively guide shifting behavior.
